# Bankroll Management

*"How much money of your asset should you risk in a trade on the market ?"*
*"How many chips of your stack should you risk in a bet when playing poker ?"*

## Introduction

This is a core point in trading and poker.

Once the market moves or the players and their hands are anticipated,
we make a decision to invest a part of our portfolio to open a position.
Then comes the very important question : how much money to bet in ?

Of course, it is related to the probablity of wining over the probability of losing.
If we had a chance to open positions with a positive expectation, we might be tempted
to dramatically increase our position.

In reality, this seldom happens because we never have this possibility. However,
even if we could bet with such  probability, would it be a good bet ?

Let's have a look on a different situations where the probabilities are well known
and easily calculable : the gambling games ! Casinos, cards, dices, etc.

## These programs
