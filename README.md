# Money and Risk Management

*"How much money should we risk in a trade on the market ?"*

## Introduction

This is a core point in trading. Once the market moves are anticipated and
we make a decision to invest a part of our portfolio to open a position,
the very important question comes : how much money ?

Of course, it is related to the probablity of wining over the probability of losing.
If we had a chance to open positions with a positive expectation, we might be tempted
to dramatically increase our position.

In reality, this seldom happens because we never have this possibility. However,
even if we could bet with such  probability, would it be a good bet ?

Let's have a look on a different situation where the probabilities are well known
and easily calculable : the gambling games ! Casinos, cards, dices, etc.

## These programs
